# MovieApp
Hi, this is gautam. And this app is based on imdb top 100 movie list. (https://github.com/hjorturlarsen/IMDB-top-100/blob/master/data/movies.json). In this movie app you can CRUD(Create, Read, Update and Delete) movie. And also there is a filter which search for a movie in no time. I tried to make unit tesing but had some difficulties to did it.

# Please go to MovieApp/app/index.html for main file
# Did it on AngularJs
# Try unit testing on karma-jasmine
